  * See the [list of papers](../assignments/presentations.md) to be presented.
* Throughout the semester, everyone is expected to
  * Give a 15-mins presentation about the paper on the assigned date.
  * Write a review report about the paper using [this form](../assignments/review-form.md).
* The grade will be based on
  * Slide preparation (2 points)
  * Presentation clarity (3 points)
  * Completeness of the report (2 points)
  * Meaningful analysis in the report (3 points)
* Submit the presentation slides as well as the review report within a week from the assigned date.

## Project Proposal

* You are expected to
  * Group a team of 2-3 people.
  * Give a 15-mins presentation to propose your idea about the final project.
  * Write a proposal that illustrates details about your idea.
* Your idea must
  * Be within the scope of this course.
  * Be plausible within this semester.
  * Include at least workshop-acceptable novelty.
* See the [project proposal](../assignments/project-proposal.md) page for more details.

## Final Project

* You are expected to
  * Give a 15-mins presentation about your final project.
  * Write a research paper that illustrates details about your work.
* Projects with
  * Outstanding results will be submitted to conferences.
  * Good results will be submitted to workshops.
  * Promising results will be submitted to arXiv.
* See the [final projects](final-projects.md) from previous years for more details.

## Extra Credits

* Extra credits up to 10 points can be earned by successfully deploying qualified NLP tools to [ELIT](https://elit.cloud).
* A tool is qualified if:
  * It gives state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmark datasets, or
  * It gives comparative accuracy against other state-of-the-art models yet runs much faster.
* Each model deployment is credited up to 5 points based on the following criteria:
  * Decoding ability via command-line and web-API (required).
  * Training ability via command-line and/or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) (optional).
  * Documentation (required).
